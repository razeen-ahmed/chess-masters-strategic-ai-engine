## üìö Theoretical Background

### Minimax Algorithm Foundations
The minimax algorithm operates on the principle of optimal play in zero-sum games, where one player's gain directly corresponds to another's loss. The algorithm assumes both players play optimally, making decisions that maximize their own utility while minimizing their opponent's.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization
Alpha-beta pruning enhances minimax by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision. This optimization maintains solution quality while dramatically reducing computational requirements, enabling deeper search in practical time constraints.

### Game-Theoretic Applications
The implemented algorithms have direct applications in:
- **Chess Engines**: Position evaluation and move selection
- **Strategic Planning**: Decision-making under competition
- **Resource Allocation**: Competitive scenario optimization
- **Economic Modeling**: Game theory analysis and auction mechanisms
